Samy Bencherif's Documentation
------------------------------

Welcome to my personal documentation space.

Each folder contains text files named in this manner.

1-name.txt
2-name.txt
3-name.txt
...

The directoies are usually 1-indexed, except for in special cases, 
such as with this readme file. 

By the way, try `source story.sh` and use the temporary alias 
`storytime` to open documentations pages in order. Use 'm' to page 
forward and 'z' to page back.

This top-level directory contains general information about the system.
Each sub-directory will contain its own set of documentation stories. 

Unnumbered files and folders withdo not need to be visited in any 
particular order.
