Samy Bencherif's Documentation
------------------------------

Welcome to my personal documentation space.

Each folder contains text files named in this manner.

1-name.txt
2-name.txt
3-name.txt
...

Obviously, they should be read in this order. This top-level 
directory contains general information about the system. Each
sub-directory will contain its own set of documentation stories.
